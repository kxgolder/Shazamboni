## Schematics and CAD Diagrams

**Notes:** This section includes all the diagrams we used in the form of schematics and CAD designs. We took inspiration from various sources linked in the reference section below. The schematic is a modified variant of an ultrasonic sensor schematic we used as a template in order to implement motor control and ultrasonic integration. Figure 1 represents the final circuit schematic of the electrical components of the Shazamboni, designed by Katie. Mei and her colleagues worked on the CAD designs seen in Figures 2-8. The CAD design focuses on the mechanical aspects of the Shazamboni for the electrical components would fit compactly in a black box featured on the front view or Figure 5. Finally, The CAD files for Figures 2-8 are listed below.

## Vendor Information and Bill of Materials

**Notes:** On the ECE side of the project, they used **Amazon** as the sole vendor for all their purchased items. On the ME side of the project, they did not reference any specific vendors besides **Amazon**. The bill of materials for both are listed below. A link for more detailed information is included at the end of the sections. The total cost of all the materials both teams used comes to $937.38, which is out of a total budget of $2000 allocated for both teams.

**Amazon** - Amazon.com is a vast Internet-based enterprise that sells books, music, movies, housewares, electronics, toys, and many other goods, either directly or as the middleman between other retailers and Amazon.com’s millions of customers. Its Web services business includes renting data storage and computing resources, so-called “cloud computing,” over the Internet. Its considerable online presence is such that, in 2012, 1 percent of all Internet traffic in North America traveled in and out of Amazon.com data centres [^1].

## Video of the Final System

**Notes:** This section shows images and a video of the final product as we, the whole team, demonstrate it for our client.

## Assembly of the Final System

**Notes:** This section includes images and videos of the final product as we, the whole team, assemble it. In wiring the Shazamboni, one will see how we wired the device. In motors, one will see how we wired the motors and overall Shazamboni together. Finally, in the final photography section, one will see the finished product. Overall, a neat and difficult project!
