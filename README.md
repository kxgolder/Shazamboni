# Shazamboni and ShazApp

 ## Summary

This GitHub details and features all the code for the project, backyard Zamboni or Shazamboni, a device and smartphone application. The main project features a remote-controlled ice surfacer that efficiently scrapes the ice of a backyard ice rink without requiring significant labor. The ShazApp controls the Shazamboni device. Katharina Golder, Bryan Jaimes, Robert Ling, & Yanni Pang, members of team 10, started and maintained this project. We created this GitHub repository for the course EC463/464 ECE Senior Design at Boston University.This specific Readme will outline the general information of the project, technologies we used, setup, our gotchas of this project,  types of things to look out for, and finally the current state of the project.

## General Info

This repository includes the code for the App and the motor/sensor controls. It also features the past attempts we have made in updating and reconfiguring our code to work with our final product. ultrasonic_distance.py and its variants are our atttempts at working on integrating the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors with our DC motors and ShazApp. l298n_dc.py controls the L298N motor driver and also are our atttempts at working on integrating the motor driver with the DC motors and ShazApp. Other files such as motor.py, robot.py, sender.py and so on are the final attempts of integrating all the pieces with Ad-Hoc networking, video streaming, and of course the motors and ultrasonic sensors.
