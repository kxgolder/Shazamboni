# Software Report

## Summary

This is a documentation that describes how all of our software works. The markdown file details Shazamboni and Shaz App use the code we wrote as well as how each script depends on or works with each other. It features an overview of each software module, flow charts of the code, dev/build tool information and finally how to install the product from scratch.
